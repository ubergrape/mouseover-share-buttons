Adds Mouseover Share-Buttons to the articles on the frontpage, category and 
archive pages.


== Description ==

Mouseover Share-Buttons give you three main benefits:

* Faster loading frontpage
* Less infos sent to Facebook, etc. (if you care for your users privacy)
* Looks beautiful

Why mouseover and not the 2-click solution? Because it converts more clicks :)

* Button Image costimization
